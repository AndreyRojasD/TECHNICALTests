# Technical test
1. we create a folder on our desktop

2. we open a terminal and go to the created folder

3. inside the terminal in the created folder we execute the following command
git clone https://github.com/CronosMorfeo/TECHNICALTests.git
4. at the end of the cloning we execute this command

```console 
cd TECHNICALTests
```


### Once the previous steps are finished, execute this command to create the docker container
```console
docker build -t python-th .
```
